Elastic Architecture Infrastructure abbreviated as `EA`, In future documents, we will all call it `EA`.

`EA` is a fast, typo-tolerant search engine for building delightful search experiences based on AI and IR.
and so EA is open source `github <https://github.com/gottingen/ea>`_.

EA focuses on building a search service framework suitable for artificial intelligence access.
The search system contains many components, including explicit requirements such as engines,
sorting, etc., but also includes configuration systems, statistics, etc. that serve the search business.
